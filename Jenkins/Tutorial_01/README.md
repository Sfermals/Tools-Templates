# Tutorial 1. Jenkins - introduction and installation



### What is Devops and Why it is important?



### Installation

#### Windows

The easiest way to install Jenkins on Windows is to use the Jenkins Windows installer. Though we can install Jenkins on linux, mac, dockers etc but in this complete series I'll be using Jenkins hosted from my windows machine. I am using jenkins war file instead of MSI installer. And there is no specific reason why I am doing so. 

[Download Link](https://www.jenkins.io/download/)

To launch jenkins using the war file, use this command:

```
java -jar jenkins.war
```

Make sure you have java installed before you run this command. Once it is up you can use jenkins at http://localhost:8080

First time it will ask for a password. You can open the file mentioned just above the password field and copy paste that initial password to login for the first time. Then you can set your profile.

After that it will ask for installation of some plugins.


#### Ubuntu
